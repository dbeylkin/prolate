# prolate
Fast and accurate routines for the computation of prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) and related quadrature.

This is a conversion of prolcrea.f and related codes (originally written by V. Rokhlin). The purpose of this conversion is severalfold:
- Provide a means to compute PSWFs and their quadratures in Matlab
- Link to LAPACK libraries
- Take advantage of allocatable arrays in Fortran 90

The conversion process is still ongoing...
